          Informatics engineer student with a strong interest in networking,
          server administration, and backend programming. I am enthusiastic
          about researching and delving into many elements of these fields, such
          as network system design, server technology, and backend development.
          Throughout their academic careers, I have developed a thorough
          understanding of computer networking ideas, server deployment, and
          backend development approaches in order to create new and efficient
          solutions.
